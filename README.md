# TrackmaniaRL
A project for AI for Society
This project is meant to show my progression of working on a Reinforcement learning AI. 
the main file i will be using is the ActorModule.py, this module is from the TMRL github and i will use and tweak this to train the ai. And the ActorEvaluation is meant to test the AI.

the different branches show the different versions of the AI i have trained and the main branch is the unchanged module.
In this ReadMe i will keep track of times from the different Branches



| **Branch** | **Time** | **Hours trained** | **Difference from main** | **Track**      |
|------------|----------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
